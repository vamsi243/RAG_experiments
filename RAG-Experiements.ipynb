      "[Document(page_content='Chapter 2\\nLinked Lists\\nLinked lists can be thought of from a high level perspective as being a series\\nof nodes. Each node has at least a single pointer to the next node, and in the\\nlast node’s case a null pointer representing that there are no more nodes in the\\nlinked list.\\nIn DSA our implementations of linked lists always maintain head and tail\\npointers so that insertion at either the head or tail of the list is a constant\\ntime operation. Random insertion is excluded from this and will be a linear\\noperation. As such, linked lists in DSA have the following characteristics:\\n1.Insertion is O(1)\\n2.Deletion is O(n)\\n3.Searching is O(n)\\nOut of the three operations the one that stands out is that of insertion. In\\nDSA we chose to always maintain pointers (or more aptly references) to the\\nnode(s) at the head and tail of the linked list and so performing a traditional\\ninsertion to either the front or back of the linked list is an O(1) operation. An\\nexception to this rule is performing an insertion before a node that is neither\\nthe head nor tail in a singly linked list. When the node we are inserting before\\nis somewhere in the middle of the linked list (known as random insertion) the\\ncomplexity is O(n). In order to add before the designated node we need to\\ntraverse the linked list to ﬁnd that node’s current predecessor. This traversal\\nyields an O(n) run time.\\nThis data structure is trivial, but linked lists have a few key points which at\\ntimes make them very attractive:\\n1.the list is dynamically resized, thus it incurs no copy penalty like an array\\nor vector would eventually incur; and\\n2.insertion is O(1).\\n2.1 Singly Linked List\\nSingly linked lists are one of the most primitive data structures you will ﬁnd in\\nthis book. Each node that makes up a singly linked list consists of a value, and\\na reference to the next node (if any) in the list.\\n9', metadata={'source': 'Dsa.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='CHAPTER 6. QUEUES 49\\n8.Enqueue(33)\\n9.Peek()\\n10.Dequeue()\\n6.1 A standard queue\\nA queue is implicitly like that described prior to this section. In DSA we don’t\\nprovide a standard queue because queues are so popular and such a core data\\nstructure that you will ﬁnd pretty much every mainstream library provides a\\nqueue data structure that you can use with your language of choice. In this\\nsection we will discuss how you can, if required, implement an eﬃcient queue\\ndata structure.\\nThe main property of a queue is that we have access to the item at the\\nfront of the queue. The queue data structure can be eﬃciently implemented\\nusing a singly linked list (deﬁned in §2.1). A singly linked list provides O(1)\\ninsertion and deletion run time complexities. The reason we have an O(1) run\\ntime complexity for deletion is because we only ever remove items from the front\\nof queues (with the Dequeue operation). Since we always have a pointer to the\\nitem at the head of a singly linked list, removal is simply a case of returning\\nthe value of the old head node, and then modifying the head pointer to be the\\nnext node of the old head node. The run time complexity for searching a queue\\nremains the same as that of a singly linked list: O(n).\\n6.2 Priority Queue\\nUnlike a standard queue where items are ordered in terms of who arrived ﬁrst,\\na priority queue determines the order of its items by using a form of custom\\ncomparer to see which item has the highest priority. Other than the items in a\\npriority queue being ordered by priority it remains the same as a normal queue:\\nyou can only access the item at the front of the queue.\\nA sensible implementation of a priority queue is to use a heap data structure\\n(deﬁned in §4). Using a heap we can look at the ﬁrst item in the queue by simply\\nreturning the item at index 0 within the heap array. A heap provides us with the\\nability to construct a priority queue where the items with the highest priority\\nare either those with the smallest value, or those with the largest.\\n6.3 Double Ended Queue\\nUnlike the queues we have talked about previously in this chapter a double\\nended queue allows you to access the items at both the front, and back of the\\nqueue. A double ended queue is commonly known as a deque which is the name\\nwe will here on in refer to it as.\\nA deque applies no prioritization strategy to its items like a priority queue\\ndoes, items are added in order to either the front of back of the deque. The\\nformer properties of the deque are denoted by the programmer utilising the data\\nstructures exposed interface.', metadata={'source': 'Dsa.pdf', 'page': 59})]\n"

As such, the information presented in this section \\nprovides a brief overview of how the corporate income tax system operates—noting \\nthere are many highly technical  rules and interpretations that affect businesses  and \\ninvestment decisions, and the amount of corporate income tax paid.   \\n2.3 While corporations pay a variety of taxes and levies (including payroll tax, \\nGST and royalties) to different levels of government, the potential for tax avoidance \\nand aggressive minimisation appears to be greatest in the area of corporate income \\ntax. That said, there are also competition concerns when corporations may have \\ndifferent costs structures because of the taxes levied on them by virtue of operating \\nfrom other jurisdictions. These issues are explored in chapter 5.  \\nCorporate income tax is levied on assessable income  \\n2.4 Australian corporations that are considered permanent establishments are \\nrequired to pay corporate income tax on assessable income. The general rate of \\ntaxation is  30 per cent but there are some variations for a small number of specific \\ncompany types. Assessable income is defined as total revenue less allowable deductions that are associated with the costs of doing business.  \\n2.5 Corporations are entitled to deduct various expenses relating to their business \\noperations. Allowable deductions include:  \\n• costs incurred in supplying goods and services, including employee costs;  \\n• interest payments on borrowed money ; \\n• depreciation and amortisation of capital goods; and  \\n• research and  development expenses.  \\n2.6 Australia has a broad- based company income tax regime which seeks to tax \\nassessable income on a territorial basis —that is, in the jurisdiction where it is sourced. \\nIf assessable income is derived from activities within Australia, then that income is \\ntaxed according to the Australian company tax regime.1  \\n                                              \\n1  Treasury, Risks to Australia's Corporate Tax Base, Scoping Paper, July 2013, p. 11.\", metadata={'source': 'ctax.pdf', 'page': 0})"

For example, BHP Billiton has paid 'top-up' tax to Australia on profits \\nrepatriated from its Singapore marketing hub.3 \\nCertain types of corporations are exempt from paying income tax  \\n2.8 While most corporations undertaking business activities are required to pay \\ncorporate income tax, certain types of  corporate entities are not liable.  \\n2.9 Partnerships and trusts are not required to pay corporate tax provided their \\nassessable income is distributed to unit holders. Unit holders are then required to pay \\neither corporate tax (in the case of a company) or personal income tax (in the case of \\nindividuals) on di stributed income on a flow-through basis.  \\n2.10 Property trusts, such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), do not pay \\ncorporate income tax on passive rental income but distribute this to investors who pay \\ntax at their own individual tax rate.4 In Australia, stapled securities are used to split \\nthe passive and active income earning activities of property investments. Active \\nincome from trading activities, such as funds management and property development, \\nare subject to corporate income tax.5  \\n2.11 Other types of  incorporated entities are also exempt from paying income tax, \\nsuch as certain non- profit organisations and charities.  \\nBreakdown of corporate tax in Australia  \\nLarge companies pay the majority of corporate income tax  \\n2.12 Over 850,000 companies lodged a tax return in 2012–13 and paid \\n$66.9 billion in company income tax.6 This represented about 19 per cent of total \\nfederal tax receipts.7  \\n2.13 Corporate tax revenue is highly concentrated with the majority of corporate \\ntax paid by only a relatively small number of companies. For example, large \\ncompanies with turnover of greater than $250  million account f or over 60 per cent of \\n                                              \\n2  By contrast, individual and 'passive' business income is taxed on a worldwide basis and, as \\nsuch, is levied on total assessable income regardless of the jurisdiction in which it is sourced. \\nThe Board of Taxation, Review of Debt and Equity Tax Rules: Discus sion Paper , March 2014.  \\n3  Answer to Question on Notice No. 14, p. 1.  \\n4  Property Council of Australia, Submission 18, p. 5.  \\n5  Property Council of Australia, Submission 18, p. 5.  \\n6  ATO, Submissi on 48 , pp. 6 –7. \\n7  Australian  Government, Re: think —Tax Discussion Paper, March 2015, p. 76.  \" metadata={'source': 'ctax.pdf', 'page': 1}\n"
